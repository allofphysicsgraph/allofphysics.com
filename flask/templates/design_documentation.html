<H2><a name="design decisions">Design Decisions</a></H2>

<P>
  The objective for the Physics Derivation Graph project is to write down
  all known mathematical physics in a way that can be both read by humans and
  checked by a computer algebra system. To do that, primary design considerations
  include how to represent the objects
  (e.g., <a href="{{ url_for('user_documentation')}}?referrer=design_documentation#inference rules">inference rules</a>
  and <a href="{{ url_for('user_documentation')}}?referrer=design_documentation#expressions">expressions</a>
  and symbols) and what data structure is sufficient.
</P><P>
  This page describes the current status and historical evoluation of design
  decisions critical to the Physics Derivation Graph.

<H2><a name="indices">Numeric indices are the core enabling concept for the Physics Derivation Graph</a></H2>
<P>
  The visualization of a graph with expressions and inference rules as nodes
  relies on each node having a distinct index.
  Each expression, symbol, and inference rule appears only once in the database.
  This is made possible through use of unique IDs associated with every facet of the visualization.
  To see what this means in terms of the "period and frequency"
  example on <a href="{{ url_for('index') }}?referrer=design_documentation">the homepage</a>,
  here is a view of the indices supporting that visualization for two sequential steps:
</P>
<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='frequency_and_period_exploded_steps.png') }}">
<BR/>
<center>
  Figure 1. Two steps with all numeric IDs shown.
</center>

<P>
  Manipulating these indices underlies all other tasks in the Physics Derivation Graph.
  Access to these indices is performed through a single data structure.
</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<HR/>
<P>&nbsp;</P>



<H2><a name="data structure">Data structure used in the Physics Derivation Graph</a></H2>
<P>
  The Physics Derivation Graph is currently stored in a single JSON file. <a href="https://github.com/allofphysicsgraph/ui_v7_website_flask_json/blob/gh-pages/flask/data.json">The JSON file</a> is read into Python as a dictionary.
</P>
<P>
  JSON is convenient because it is plain text and the ease of detailed validation available using schemas.
  The many alternatives to JSON (e.g., SQLite, Redis, Python Pickle, CSV, GraphML) offer trade-offs, a few of which <a href="{{ url_for('comparison_of_design_options_database') }}?referrer=design_documentation">have been explored</a>.

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<HR/>
<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H2><a name="latex for expressions">\(\rm\LaTeX\) representation of expressions</a></H2>
<P>
  There are multiple choices of how to represent a mathematical expression.
  The choices feature trade-offs between conciseness, ability to express the range of notations necessary for Physics, symantic meaning, and ability to use the expression in a computer algebra system (CAS).
  See the <a href="{{ url_for('comparison_of_design_options_syntax') }}?referrer=design_documentation">comparison of syntax</a> below.
  \(\rm\LaTeX\) was selected primarily because of the common use in Physics, display of complex math, conciseness, and expressiveness.
  The use of \(\rm\LaTeX\) means other tasks like parsing symbols and resolving ambiguity are harder.

<H2><a name="not in scope">Outside of Current Scope</a></H2>

<P>Although the Physics Derivation Graph is intended to be comprehensive
  across domains, there are aspect of Physics not within the current scope of the project:
<UL>
  <LI>inclusion of graphics, e.g. free body diagrams, Feynman diagrams, geometrical diagrams.
  <LI>explanatory text,
  <LI>animations of concepts,
  <LI>experimental processes,
  <LI>interactive models.
</UL>
These aspects could be included if the data structure and workflow were adapted
to an expanded scope.
