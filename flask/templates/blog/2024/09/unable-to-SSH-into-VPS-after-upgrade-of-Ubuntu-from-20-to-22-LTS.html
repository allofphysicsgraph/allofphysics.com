<H1>unable to SSH into VPS after upgrade of Ubuntu from 20 to 22 LTS</H1>

<P><small>Published 2024-09-02T17:33:00Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

<p>Prior to upgrading from Ubuntu 20 to 22 LTS I was able to SSH from my local laptop to a remote VPS using the command</p>
<pre>ssh -v username@IPaddress
</pre>

<p>After the upgrade I got
</p><pre>ssh -v username@IPaddress
OpenSSH_9.7p1, LibreSSL 3.3.6
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config
debug1: /etc/ssh/ssh_config line 21: include /etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/* matched no files

</p><pre>sudo systemctl status ssh

and got 
<pre>Active: active (running)

</p><span></span><span><!--more--></span><p>On the remote VPS I reviewed the contents of <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code></p>

<p>I verified that SSH is exposed on port 22 using</p>
<pre>sudo lsof -Pi | grep ssh</pre>

<p>On the VPS I monitored
</p><pre>sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log</pre>
and concurrent attempted to log in from my local laptop
<pre>ssh -v username@IPaddress
</pre>
Since no entries were showing up in auth.log, maybe there's a firewall configured?

<p>Yes, firewall exists; see <a href="https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2020/09/ufw-allow-status-numbered-delete.html">https://physicsderivationgraph.blogspot.com/2020/09/ufw-allow-status-numbered-delete.html  
</a></p><pre>$ sudo ufw status verbose
Status: active
Logging: on (low)
Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), deny (routed)
New profiles: skip
</pre>

I temporarily disabled the firewall on the VPS using
<pre>sudo ufw disable</pre>
as per https://ubuntu.com/server/docs/firewalls and then monitored 
<pre>sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log</pre>
while trying to SSH from my laptop, but that didn't make a difference. Therefore I can rule out the firewall as blocking SSH. I then ran
<pre>sudo ufw enable</pre>

<hr />
<p>Next I enabled password-based auth in <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> with
  </p><pre>PasswordAuthentication yes</pre>
and then
<pre>sudo service ssh restart</pre>
Then tried to SSH from my laptop but still no difference -- just a time-out and no new lines in <code>/var/log/auth.log</code>.

<hr />
<pre>ping google.com
ping: google.com: Temporary failure in name resolution</pre>

I inspected the content of 
<pre>/etc/resolv.conf</pre>
which has the line
<pre>nameserver 127.0.0.53
options edns0 trust-ad
search .</pre>

<pre>resolvectl status</pre>

<pre>journalctl -u systemd-resolved -f</pre>

<hr />

<p>Actually, my DNS might not be the issue:</p>
<pre>ping 8.8.8.8
ping: connect: network is unreachable
</pre>

<p>The DNS problem is described on https://askubuntu.com/questions/1452215/dns-resolution-broken-after-upgrading-ubuntu-20-04-to-22-04 but 
</p><pre>sudo dpkg-reconfigure resolveconf</pre>but that doesn't work:
<pre>dpkg-query: package 'resolveconf' is not installed and no information is available.</pre>

<p>The thread https://askubuntu.com/questions/1436144/no-network-after-upgrading-from-ubuntu-20-04-to-ubuntu-22-04 also didn't provide any insights for my situation.</p><p></p>
