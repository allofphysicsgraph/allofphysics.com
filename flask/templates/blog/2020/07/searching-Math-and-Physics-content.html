<H1>searching Math and Physics content</H1>

<P><small>Published 2020-07-31T13:03:00.001Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

The workflow for naive web search is<br />
<ol>
<li>input query</li>
<li>click on search</li>
<li>get results</li>
</ol>
<div>
This is the dominant mindset and is based on use of Google for finding web content.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
Revising the search string is taken as a failure.</div>
<div>
Looking at the second page of results is taken as a failure.</div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
That doesn't need to be the process for search. Interactive refinement of queries is a significant improvement since the user might not realize what's available.</div>

What would searching Math and Physics be like?<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Leveraging Latex would be important since that is the style the bulk of content uses.</li>
<li>Tagging sections would be useful to differentiate claim/lemma/theorem. Documents with sTeX markup or OMdoc could provide better results.</li>
<li>Identifying symbol meanings (operators, constants, variables) in expressions. Using "x" for position and "d" for position should be treated as equivalent.</li>
</ul>
