Modifications or extensions are feasible, but the domain is "solved." The theory won't be displaced.</li><li><i>Examples</i>: general relativity, Newtonian dynamics, Newtonian gravity.</li></ul><li><b>Weak understanding</b> = more than one theory can account for the data. Unable to discriminate which is relevant since theories make the same predictions. (defined by SMC at 15:44)</li><ul><li><i>Consequences</i>: Not clear theory which is right. Right theory may not have been invented yet.</li><li><i>Examples</i>:&nbsp;</li><ul><li>Foundations of quantum mechanics (e.g., Copenhagen interpretation, Bohemian, many worlds, jaggets platz)</li><li>dark matter and dark energy in cosmology. Properties are known, but multiple theories</li><ul><li>dark matter: WIMPS, axions,&nbsp;</li><li>dark energy: vacuum energy, dynamical quintesense-like fields</li></ul></ul></ul><li><b>No understanding</b> = have data but no theory (defined by SMC at 18:20)</li><ul><li><i>Examples</i>: what happens at or before the big bang</li></ul></ul><div><u>SMC's claim</u>: We have either a strong or weak understanding of everything that is accessible through measurement. (at 21:40) There's nothing that's experimentally accessible and not understood. That's new!</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><h3 style="text-align: left;">Survey of domains and relations</h3><div><i>What is it that we know?</i></div><div><br /></div><div>Newtonian dynamics.
