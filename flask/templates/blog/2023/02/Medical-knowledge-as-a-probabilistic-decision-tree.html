<H1>Medical knowledge as a probabilistic decision tree</H1>

<p>Medical reasoning can sound like a large decision tree ("if this then that"). This post documents the nuances that render a decision tree data structure inadequate.&nbsp;</p><p></p><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><i>Nuances about input data</i></li><ul><li>Extracting facts relevant to diagnosis is challenging.&nbsp;</li><ul><li>A parent of an infant may report their baby is not eating much, but does that mean the baby is refusing food, sleepy, crying, vomiting...</li></ul><li>Looking merely at the current symptoms is inadequate.

This is one area where some doctors say that doctors are better than nurse practitioners. The nurse practitioner tells the patient the most likely diagnosis, but the doctor knows other diagnoses that are less likely, but should not be missed and counsel accordingly. In other words, just guessing based on a "most likely" diagnosis is insufficient. Are there "do not miss" outcomes that could be explanatory for the diagnosis?</li><li>Suggestions for action by the patient includes, "what to do if this other symptom arises" or "what to do if this symptom persists"</li></ul><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system#Disadvantages">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system#Disadvantages</a></div><div><br /></div><div>The clinical decision analysis using decision tree</div><div>doi&nbsp;10.4178/epih/e2014025</div><div><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4251295/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4251295/</a></div><div><br /></div><p></p>
