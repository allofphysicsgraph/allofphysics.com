<H1>including Lean proofs in a property graph data structure</H1>

<P><small>Published 2023-12-25T00:52:00Z by Physics Derivation Graph</small></P>

<P>The data structure for the Physics Derivation Graph is a property graph. Equations are nodes and Inference Rules are nodes. The equation node can have properties like "Latex representation" and "SymPy represenetation." 

<P>What is a property graph representation of a lean proof?

<P>How would a SymPy representation be related to the Lean proof? Need to relate latex to sympy to lean.

<P>A symbol representation between Latex and Sympy and Lean is the Physics Derivation Graph is a unique numeric ID.
