Working from textbooks like those from Berend Smit's Understanding Molecular Simulation and Allan and Tildesleyâ€™s textbook.

The textbook you linked to also seems to cover the basics all right. For the dynamics, we will need to 
<UL>
  <LI>implement velocity verlet and/or verlet and 
  <LI>prove that these algorithms converge to the true dynamics in the limit of infinitesimal time step. 
</UL>
