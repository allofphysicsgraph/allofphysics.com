"""
The purpose of this file is to transform between Latex to SymPy
The reason this scope has been isolated is to facilitate changing the Computer Algebra System (CAS) to something other than SymPy if that becomes relevant.
For example, two different Computer Algebra Systems could be used with the Physics Derivation Graph (e.g., Sympy and Sage) to either duplicate a given validation or to extend coverage to inference rules one of the CAS cannot address.

In the situation where another CAS like Sage is used, a separate "latex_and_sage.py" module would be created.
